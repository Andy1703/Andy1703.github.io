<h2><u>Interest in IT</u></h2>
<ul>
  <h3> <mark>What is my interest in IT?</mark></h3>
    <li>	For a lot of people, a good application needs complex requirements such as good design, good shortcuts and the high technique of inventing them. However, the thing that impresses technology is that most people pay attention to big companies like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and so on. Few noticed the features of the apps of other developers. On the other hand, the fairy tale about "Flappy Bird" changed my personal mind about IT. Flappy Bird was designed by "Dong Nguyen" with extremely outdated designs for game creation and achieved the success that even the creators themselves did not think they achieved. Because of that, it made me impressed that IT is not only good at their knowledge but also requires a lot of ways to view their application development by their own creation.
    </li>
    <h3> <mark>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</mark></h3>
    <li> 	Because the IT industry in RMIT is highly appreciated and its IT curriculum is based on international programs.
    </li>
    <h3> <mark>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</mark></h3>
    <li> 	Understand the fundamentals of IT so that you can develop in the most comprehensive way.

<h2> <u> Project Ideal </u> </h2>
<ul>
  <h3> <mark>Overview:</mark> </h3>
  <p> Overall, this will be a smart and automatic watering project. This project will include the installation of a sprinkler system and temperature sensor system for each area separately. Moreover, this is not only a simple automatic watering project but also includes an analysis of the plant's condition and its growth environment. It will help optimize plant growth and achieve the same results on a large scale. Because of that, such benefits save labor, time and quantity of production will be significantly increased. This will be a technology suitable for Vietnam's environment, it will help farmers and industry of Vietnam to achieve success in the future.
  </p>

  <h3> <mark> Motivation: </mark> </h3>
  <p> I was born in the countryside so the environment around me is mostly a farm. However, the industry in these regions is difficult to thrive because of the lack of manpower and erratic weather. That led to the fact that these agricultural products were not of good quality. Consequently, I wanted to create an automatic watering project to help people in the same areas as above. Furthermore, this project will also help my family's farm grow better if it succeeds.
  </p>

  <h3> <mark> Description: </mark> </h3>
  <p> A smart and automatic watering project will have 2 main steps which are to set irrigation and ambient sensor systems. Firstly, the irrigation system will be distributed correctly in each area so that when watering will ensure the amount of water to water the plants in an equal amount. For instance, the installation of an automatic irrigation system for orange trees will be the position between the 4 trees, it will help when watering those 4 orange trees will have an equal amount of water and at the same time of day. Moreover, even if a farm is guaranteed that every tree will have the same watering regime, the quality of the oranges will always be the same and guaranteed. Besides orange trees, all such agricultural produce as vegetables, potatoes and even ornamental plants will have similar results.
  </p>
  <p>Secondly, ambient sensor systems will also be installed based on application calculations. This system will be placed high above and around the habitat of these trees and all other surrounding areas. Moreover, their task will be to collect information about temperature, light, humidity and wind to give information about the center of the application. Accordingly, according to the data that the application has collected, the programmed system will analyze the status of the trees in each area, which will result in how to provide suitable and timely solutions for trees. On the other hand, after receiving information and analysis from ambient sensor systems, there will be a programmed program for the watering system to adjust the amount of water accordingly (this amount of water will include fertilizer dissolve in water to come). For instance, on dry days, ambient sensor systems will notify the system's main center that the orange tree area is in need of water and this dry environment will directly affect the tree. Based on the analytical information, the irrigation system will be adjusted to irrigate with more water and appropriate fertilizer to help stabilize the orange trees.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, once the system is complete, its owners can directly view the status of the plants through analysis and reports of ambient sensor systems. Moreover, the user will not need to go directly to the planting area to control the device because the system will be integrated on the system's computer and will grow to be compatible with the phone if the user is not directly located at the computer-controlled position. For example, when the system owner does not need to go to the location of each tree in hot weather but instead in the control area to check everything on the data. In addition, when they have a job they cannot stay on the farm and have to go to another city, they can still connect to the device by phone to control and check the situation of the tree. In short, an intelligent and automatic watering project will be installed with all the information based on the most accurate experts to ensure that there will be no errors in interpreting and adjusting the water volume for suitable.
  </p>

<h3> <mark> Tool and technologies:</mark> </h3>
  <p> Components of automatic irrigation systems such as Sensors, Actuators. On the other hand, the amount of water adjusted is based on the Programmable Volume measured using a flow meter or level sensors.
 Ambient sensor systems are based on programming based on weather data from a weather station. For instance, the Inut sensor will be tested on Ambient sensor systems. Inut sensors are developed based on the platform including ESP8266 and Arduino Uno. Moreover, a full set of sensor iNut will include a sensor iNut module with an Arduino Uno, and finally a USB Type B cable for transferring data and programs from a computer to the Arduino.
  </p>

<h3> <mark> Skills Required: </mark> </h3>
  <p> In order to implement a smart and automatic watering project, knowledge of programming is required. That will help me write the commands myself to suit each tree's situation. Moreover, in order to complete this project, you also need to know about the sensor system that requires knowledge of the embedded array. It will help me write programs that run on electronic devices. Embedded is used in C, C ++ or maybe Java language. The desktop app array will also help make the app programming connected to the phone automatic irrigation system. The desktop app array is also based on C, C ++ or Python
  </p>

<h3> <mark> Outcome: </mark> </h3>
  <p> If this project is successful, it will be of great help to Vietnam's agricultural sector. For instance, it will save a lot of manpower, time to water the plants and the accuracy of the product will be significantly increased. Moreover, it will also help to reduce costs and watering. The problem of farmers worried when the weather directly affects the trees will also be solved by the benefits of this system will bring.
