    <h1><u> IT Profile</u></h1>

    <h2> Personal Information </h2>
    <img src="Andy.jpg"width="200">
<p> <mark>Name:</mark> Le Anh Tuan </p>
<p> <mark>ID:</mark> S3836290 </p>
<p> <mark>Email:</mark> S3836290@rmit.edu.vn </p>

<p> 1.	Nationality & Culture: Vietnam </p>

<p> 4.	Facts: Interested in technology and want to learn how to design applications for modern life. Moreover, extremely love cats and cooking.
</p>

<h2><u>Interest in IT</u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>	For a lot of people, a good application needs complex requirements such as good design, good shortcuts and the high technique of inventing them. However, the thing that impresses technology is that most people pay attention to big companies like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and so on. Few noticed the features of the apps of other developers. On the other hand, the fairy tale about "Flappy Bird" changed my personal mind about IT. Flappy Bird was designed by "Dong Nguyen" with extremely outdated designs for game creation and achieved the success that even the creators themselves did not think they achieved. Because of that, it made me impressed that IT is not only good at their knowledge but also requires a lot of ways to view their application development by their own creation.
    </li><br>
    <li> 	Because the IT industry in RMIT is highly appreciated and its IT curriculum is based on international programs.
    </li><br>
    <li> 	Understand the fundamentals of IT so that you can develop in the most comprehensive way.
    </li>
 </ul>

<h3> Interesting thing in this position:</h3> <p>IOS is a platform that I personally find very impressive and extremely enjoy using them. That's why being an iOS developer is a job that I personally like to do it in the future.
</p>

<h3> How to get this job:</h3> <p> In my opinion, if you want to match the position of iOS developers in the above company, you don't just need a BS / MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related subject. Besides, an iOS developer must have an understanding of languages suitable for IOS platform such as swift, Objective-C. In addition, the experience will also be a great advantage for yourself if you want to be applied in the position of iOS developers.

<h3>My current experience :</h3>
<p>As a beginner in IT, having experience is almost impossible. However, learning about the job in the IT industry I am interested in will help me develop better because of the preparation.
</p>
<h3> What i need to learn: </h3>
<p>To appropriate the position of iOS developers, I will need to learn how to use the Swift language. Moreover, I will need to understand the basic syntax of custom control and initialization and air handling control classes of Hareton. In addition to Swift, I also need to know about spatial reasoning, basically an understanding of how to think in 3D. Last but not least, mastering Git and uploading my own research to Github is also something I need to learn to be able to get suggestions for my products later.
